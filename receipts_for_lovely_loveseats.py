#We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street.
#We’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.
#We will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables.
#Process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.
